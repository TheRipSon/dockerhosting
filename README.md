### Updated High-Level Plan

1.  **Frontend (React):**

    -   Users can view projects and make code edits via an embedded code editor (like Monaco or CodeMirror).
    -   Users can interact with buttons to build and run Docker containers for specific projects.
2.  **Backend (Django + PostgreSQL):**

    -   Django handles API requests to build, run, stop, and restart Docker containers.
    -   PostgreSQL stores project metadata (like project paths, configuration).
    -   Django handles receiving and saving the modified code from the frontend.
3.  **Docker Integration:**

    -   Each project has a Dockerfile that is used to build the container when the user requests it.
    -   Containers are managed via Docker's Python SDK (inside Django).
    -   Users' code modifications are injected into the corresponding Docker volume or image before running the container.

### Feature Breakdown

#### 1\. **File Modification (Frontend):**

-   Use **Monaco Editor** or **CodeMirror** in React to provide an in-browser code editor.
-   Allow users to modify the code of specific projects (read/write functionality via Django API).
-   The changes will be stored temporarily and sent to the backend when they request the project to run.

#### 2\. **Docker Container Control (Backend):**

-   Use Django to trigger Docker commands through the **Docker SDK for Python**.
-   Manage Docker containers (start, stop, restart) for each project.
-   Handle file modifications by either:
    -   Mounting the modified code into a **Docker volume** when running the container.
    -   Rebuilding the Docker image with the modified code, then running it.

#### 3\. **Routing and Forwarding:**

-   After a container is successfully running, forward the user to the app (probably running on some localhost port) using **Django routing**.
-   Use Django to handle dynamic port assignments (so multiple containers can run).

### Core Challenges & Solutions

1.  **File System Management:**

    -   When users modify code, you need to reflect that in the container.
    -   Either mount the project files as **volumes** inside the container or **copy** the files into the container during the Docker build process.
2.  **Container Lifecycle Management:**

    -   You will need endpoints (API) in Django to manage starting, stopping, and restarting containers.
    -   To avoid resource exhaustion, consider auto-cleaning old containers after some time.
3.  **Security Concerns:**

    -   Running user-provided code in Docker containers is potentially risky. To mitigate:
        -   Limit network access for the containers (use Docker's network isolation features).
        -   Set resource limits (CPU, memory) on containers.
        -   Consider sandboxing strategies to prevent any malicious actions.
4.  **Real-time Logs/Output:**

    -   Allow users to see real-time logs from their running containers. This can be done using **Docker logs** through the Docker SDK.

### Example Workflow

1.  **Frontend**:

    -   User selects a project.
    -   The code for the project is loaded into an editor.
    -   The user edits the code and presses "Run."
2.  **Backend**:

    -   Django receives the code, saves it temporarily, and runs Docker commands to either:
        -   Mount the code into a running container.
        -   Rebuild the Docker image with the modified code.
    -   Django starts the container and routes the user to the running app's port.
3.  **User Forwarding**:

    -   After the container is started, the user is redirected to a unique URL (e.g., `localhost:8080`).

### Tools and Libraries

-   **Frontend**:

    -   React + **Monaco Editor** or **CodeMirror**.
    -   RESTful API to interact with Django for triggering Docker builds and code modifications.
-   **Backend**:

    -   Django + Django REST Framework for API.
    -   **Docker SDK for Python** to manage containers.
    -   PostgreSQL for storing project metadata and container info.
    -   Use Django's file handling to store modified code.




### Updated Plan with Requirements

#### **Front-end (HTML, CSS, JS):**

1.  **Purpose of the Website:**

    -   Your site will be a **portfolio/dashboard** to display projects and allow users to interact with them.
2.  **HTML5 Standard:**

    -   The site will adhere to **HTML5**. This is done natively when using React since JSX compiles down to HTML5-compliant code.
3.  **Head and Body Structure:**

    -   React abstracts away the need to manually handle `<head>` and `<body>`, but you'll define a proper structure in the main `index.html` file (React handles the rest).
        -   **React's root structure** will ensure the necessary HTML structure is maintained.
4.  **Appropriate Page Structure:**

    -   Use semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc. in React components to ensure the structure is organized.
        -   **React Components** can encapsulate these sections for better reusability.
5.  **Two-Level Menu:**

    -   Implement a **multi-level navigation menu** using either a dropdown or expandable sidebar in React.
6.  **Text, Graphics, Tables, Lists, Links:**

    -   Include:
        -   **Text elements** with various formatting styles (use at least 5 different text formats, e.g., bold, italics, font size, color, etc.).
        -   **Graphics:** Ensure all images have required attributes like `alt`.
        -   **Tables:** Render tabular data when showing project details.
        -   **Lists:** Use lists to show recurring items, e.g., a list of projects.
        -   **Links:** Provide links to different subpages (like project details).
7.  **Responsive Layout (RWD):**

    -   Use **CSS Grid, Flexbox**, and **Media Queries** to create a responsive layout with at least **three breakpoints** (mobile, tablet, desktop).
        -   React with CSS can easily handle this.
8.  **Consistent Styling:**

    -   Externalize **CSS** to a dedicated file. Ensure all styling changes are applied through this file.
    -   Apply a consistent set of **CSS classes** to repeated elements like lists of articles or project cards.
9.  **Dynamic Elements:**

    -   Elements like buttons for starting containers should change appearance when hovered (tooltips, change of color, etc.).
    -   Dynamically hide/show certain elements (like logs or outputs from running containers) using **JavaScript** in React.
10. **CSS Techniques (Block/Inline/Position):**

    -   Ensure to use CSS properties like `block`, `inline`, and different `position` values (e.g., relative, absolute) to control the layout behavior.
    -   Implement this for things like headers, footers, and images in your portfolio.

#### **JavaScript (React):**

1.  **Change Visibility of Elements:**

    -   Use React state to toggle visibility of elements (e.g., a "details" section or logs from running containers).
2.  **Change Appearance of Elements:**

    -   Implement style changes (e.g., colors, borders) in React dynamically based on user actions (e.g., clicking a button to run a container changes its state).
3.  **Change Structure of the Page:**

    -   Allow users to dynamically interact with elements on the page, such as adding new projects, editing code, or running Docker containers, which would alter the page structure.
4.  **Provide New Information:**

    -   When a user starts or edits a project, new information should be presented dynamically (e.g., log output, project status).

#### **Back-end (Django + Docker + PostgreSQL):**

1.  **Online Availability:**

    -   The system will be deployed online using Docker, ensuring it's accessible from anywhere.
2.  **User Account and Permissions:**

    -   Use **Django's built-in authentication system** to handle user accounts and permissions.
    -   Users will need to log in to access specific features like editing code or running Docker containers.
3.  **Database Resource Presentation:**

    -   Use Django + PostgreSQL to store project metadata (e.g., project names, descriptions, container status).
    -   Display project data dynamically on the frontend (React) through Django's **REST API**.
4.  **Database Resource Manipulation:**

    -   Allow users to add, modify, or delete projects from the portfolio (CRUD operations using Django and React).
    -   Backend will handle the saving of code edits and updating metadata.
5.  **File-based Resource Presentation and Manipulation:**

    -   The project source files will be stored on the server and can be accessed or modified by users.
    -   Users will edit these files via the React code editor and their changes will be saved to the server (and reflected in Docker containers).
6.  **Frameworks and Libraries:**

    -   **Django** is used for all backend logic, handling the user authentication, database operations, and API endpoints.
    -   **React** is used for building the frontend and providing dynamic user interaction.
    -   **Docker SDK for Python** in Django will handle the creation, running, and stopping of Docker containers.
